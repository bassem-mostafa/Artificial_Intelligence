# Perceptive field

Refers to the region of the input image that a particular neuron in a convolutional layer is “looking at” or taking into account when making its predictions or feature extractions.

Understanding the receptive field in a CNN is crucial because it helps in interpreting what information is being captured by different layers and neurons in the network.
